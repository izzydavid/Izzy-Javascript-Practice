//Izzy walkthrough on the introduction of Javascript on 10JUN2019

// One way to create a variable types 
var a = 20; 
var b = 20;  
var sum = a + b; 

// Second way to create a variable types
var a, b, sum; 
a = 20; 
b = 20; 
sum = a + b; 

// Third way to create a variable types

var a = 20, b = 20, sum = a + b; 
console.log(sum);

// Creating a variable with a string
var a = "My name is David"; 
console.log(a);

// How your code can automatically declare your variables without you specifiying their declarations. 
// The alternatives of CONST and LENTs are the other methods to get around this issues.
// Since this issue would create issues for us later on. 
a = 10; 
console.log(a);

//Topic is Data Types 
//String Data Type
var name = "David \"it's\" Irizarry"; 
console.log(name);

//Numeric Data Type 
var num1 = 123456789; 
var num2 = 1231415135.1232141235112313; 

console.log(num1, num2);

//Boolean Data Type

var bool1 = true; 
var bool2 = false; 
var bool3 = 1; //1 is true and 0 is false in boolean data type
var bool4 = 0; //0 is false in boolean data type

//Undefined data 
var hey; 
console.log(hey);

//Null data type 
var hey2 =  null; 
console.log(typeof bool3); //When you type typeof it does not necessarily mean the data type is an object, 
//the browswer does not know how to define a "null"

//Assignment Operators is the third topic 

// =
// +=
// -=
// *= 
// /=
// %= 
//Cannot have the operators not commented out when trying to console log your javascript. 
var number = 10; 
// number = number + 5; 
number += 5; 
console.log(number);

//Arithmetic Operators

// +
// -
// *
// /
//Cannot have the operators not commented out when trying to console log your javascript. 
var number2 = 5 * 10; 
console.log(number2);



//String Operators is the Fourth Topic
var age = 33; 
var info = "My name is David, I am " + age + " years old, and I am a software developer wannabe!"

console.log(info);

var numbers = 4 + " " + 5; 
console.log(numbers);

//Conditional Statement is the Fifth Topic 

var x = 10; 
var y = 50; 

//Example of how to comparison operator == to see if the value is the same as the declared var x. 
//Example of an OR operator is what is known as the pipes symbol "||" to see if one of the if statements are true; 
//return the conlsole log with the "If!" string. 
//Example of when we want more than one if statement to be true we would use the "&&" term between each comparison 
//Example of an if & else & else if statement and how the script is reading the statement in sequence, therefore if the
//first statement is true, it will not go through the rest of the else if or else statement because the first if statement
//was true
if (x == 10 && y < 20) {  
    console.log("If!");
}   else if (x > 50) { 
    console.log("Else if!"); 
}   else if (x > 50) { 
    console.log("Else if!"); 
}   else if (x > 50) { 
    console.log("Else if!"); 
}   else {
    console.log("Else!"); 
}

var gender = "Male"; 
var age = 18; 

if (gender == "Male") {
    if (age === 18) { 
        console.log("You are a " + gender + " and above the age limit");
    } else { 
    console.log("Sorry dude!");
    }
} else if (gender == "Female") {
  if (age >= 18) { 
    console.log("You are a " + gender + " and above the age limit");
  } else { 
      console.log("Sorry lady!");
  }  
} else { 
    console.log("Can't figure out your gender!");
}

//How to create an arrays in Javascript is the sixth topic

var items = ["Bottle", "Camera", "Juice"]; 
var items;
console.log(items[0]);

var items = ["Bottle", 4, true];  //This is an array which contains a string, integer, and boolean logic
items[1] = 8; //This is a way to re-assign the value to an array 
console.log(items[1]); //This is console loging the position 1 in the var items arrray, the reason why 4 is console logged; 
//is because the position of an array is 0,1,2 since we only have three data types in the array. 

//Javascript Properties and Methods is the seventh topic 
var item = "Bottle of water"; 
console.log(item.length); //The period after the item is letting you do something with this property or method. You get 15
//because it is counting the number of characters including the spaces of the string. 

console.log(item.indexOf("of")); //We need to always use a pair of parathesis after indexOf defines that we are using a method
//or function 
console.log(item.substring(7, 9)); //Substring does something different, allows us to cut off a certain object or string at a 
//certain point 7 is the position of the space before the word "of" and 9 is the space after the word "of". 
console.log(item.replace("water", "Juice")); //Example of how to replace something within the declared variable water turned into juice. 
console.log(item.toUpperCase());//Method of how to make the variable capitalized 

var items = ["Bottles", 4, true]; 
items.pop(); //Removes the last piece of data type within the string
console.log(items.join(" | & | "));//This pulls all the data types in the array together but without spaces unless specified in the (). 
console.log(items.join(", "));
items.push("Juice"); 
console.log(items.push("Juice"));

//How to create a Javascript Functions is the eigth topic. 
//A Function is a set of instructions or reuse our code later in our scripts: Immediate results, 
//name function, annoynomous function, immediate function expression.
